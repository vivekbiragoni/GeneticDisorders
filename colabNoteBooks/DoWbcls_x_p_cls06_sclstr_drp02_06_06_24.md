- **Top-5 Accuracy:** Not explicitly mentioned, but implied high performance due to Top-1 Accuracy

#### Training Progress:
- The training process included automatic mixed precision (AMP) checks, which passed successfully.
- The model achieved its best performance at epoch 18, after which early stopping was triggered due to no significant improvement over the next 15 epochs.
- The final model was saved as `best.pt`.

#### Validation and Testing:
- After training, the model was validated and tested, showing excellent performance with a Top-1 Accuracy of 95.7%.

#### Notes:
- The training session encountered a warning related to `os.fork()` being incompatible with multithreaded code, which could potentially lead to deadlocks. This is a known issue when using certain multiprocessing libraries in conjunction with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch.
- Despite the warning, the training proceeded without apparent issues, indicating robustness against such warnings under the given conditions.

### Important Results:
- The model achieved a Top-1 Accuracy of 95.7%, demonstrating strong performance on the custom dataset.
- The training process utilized advanced features like AMP and AutoBatch to optimize resource usage and speed up training.
- Early stopping was effectively used to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
