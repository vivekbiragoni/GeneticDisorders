### Dataset Information:
- **Dataset Location**: `/content/datasets/autismDatasetOut`
- **Classes**: 2
- **Training Images**: 2058
- **Validation Images**: 588
- **Test Images**: 294

### Performance Metrics:
- **Loss**: Reduced significantly over the course of training, reaching 0.02342 at epoch 46 and 0.01613 at epoch 47.
- **Instances Processed**: Approximately 21 instances per iteration across multiple epochs.
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: Improved to 0.878 during validation.
- **Top-5 Accuracy**: Not explicitly mentioned, but implied to be high given the context.
- **Early Stopping**: Implemented with a patience of 15 epochs. Training stopped early as no improvement was observed in the last 15 epochs, with the best results observed at epoch 32.

### Additional Notes:
- The model used Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for efficient training on NVIDIA GPUs.
- The training process utilized AutoBatch for optimizing the batch size based on available GPU memory.
- An issue with `os.fork()` being called in a multithreaded environment was noted, which could potentially lead to deadlocks.
- The training was interrupted due to the EarlyStopping condition, with the best model saved as `best.pt`.
- After training, the model was validated again, showing improved accuracy metrics.
- The final model was synced to the Ultralytics HUB for easy access and sharing.

This summary captures the essence of the training process, highlighting the model's architecture, dataset characteristics, and performance improvements throughout the training phase.
