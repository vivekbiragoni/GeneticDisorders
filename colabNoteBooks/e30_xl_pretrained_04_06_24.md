### Dataset Preparation
- Unzipped dataset from `/content/datasets/GD_out.zip` to `/content/datasets/GD_out`.
- Found a total of **4117** images for training, **1175** images for validation, and **590** images for testing across **4 classes**.

### Model Configuration
- Overrode `model.yaml` configuration to adjust the number of classes (`nc`) from **1000** to **4**, aligning with the dataset's class count.
- The model architecture includes several convolutional layers (`Conv`) and bottleneck modules (`C2f`), with varying numbers of parameters and configurations to handle the reduced class count efficiently.

### Training Setup
- Utilized Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for efficient training on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU.
- Optimized batch size computation for image size **256** pixels.
- Detected CUDA memory usage and adjusted the batch size accordingly to ensure optimal performance without exceeding available GPU memory.
- Initialized training with **AdamW optimizer**, adjusting learning rate (`lr`) and momentum based on automatic determination for optimal performance.

### Training Progress
- Completed **30 epochs** of training, observing significant improvements in both training and validation losses over time.
- Achieved high accuracy rates, with the final epoch showing **top1_accuracy** and **top5_accuracy** close to **90%** on the validation set.
- Noted warnings related to `os.fork()` being incompatible with multithreaded code, which could potentially lead to deadlocks, although it did not impact the training process significantly.

### Model Evaluation and Saving
- After training, the model's weights were saved, including both the last checkpoint and the best performing model based on validation metrics.
- Validated the best model weights and observed consistent performance, indicating successful training and model generalization.
- Final model evaluation showed improved speed in preprocessing and inference stages compared to initial setup.

### Model Sharing
- Uploaded the trained model to the Ultralytics HUB for sharing and further use, providing a link for viewing and downloading the model.
