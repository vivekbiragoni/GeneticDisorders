## Getting Started

To start using myYolo for image classification, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset: Organize your image dataset into appropriate directories.
2. Configure the model: Adjust the configuration file (e.g., `yolov8-cls.yaml`) to suit your classification task requirements.
3. Train the model: Use the provided training script to train your classification model on the prepared dataset.
4. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate validation dataset.
5. Make predictions: Use the trained model to classify new images and make predictions.
